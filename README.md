# InterChromosomal-Enhancer-Promoter-Interaction-in-Human-Genome

Introduction:
Enhancer and Promoter play very important role in human genome to perform Gene-Regulation, Gene-Exression through transcription and translation processes. By performing Gene-Regulation and Gene-Exression, DNA produces protein from amino acids. Usually, an enhancer (starts Gene-Exression) starts the Gene-Expression process to express a gene. For that purpose, enhancer interacts with a promoter (a region in-front of a gene) for initiating the Gene-Exression. This is called Enhancer-Promoter interaction. We used to know that enhancer interacts with a promoter in a same chromosome. But new study suggests that, enhancer of one chromosome can interact with a promoter that resides in another chromosome. This is called InterChromosomal Enhancer-Promoter Interaction.
My computation is to find the InterChromosomal Enhancer-Promoter Interaction, Interacted regions, and most interacted Enhancers.

Technology Used:
  - Python.
  - Linux Environment.
  - Genome data analysis through genome browser.


Computational Steps: 
- Analyzed human genome to find out promoter.
- Analyzed human genome to find out enhancer.
- Analyzed human genome to find out known genes.
- Find out the Enhancer-Promoter intereacted regions between two Chromosomes.
- From there, I could find out the most important and interacted enhancer of human genome.
